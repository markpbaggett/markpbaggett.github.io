:summary: Can anything be initiated without an obligatory hello world?

Hello World! Is there ever a more appropriate or trite first to anything? If there is, I am not aware of it.

I've been using the internet as long as I've had access to it. I have lived through and participated in Web 2.0 and the
earliest days of social networking with Makeout Club and Friendster, but never before now have I had a personal website
or blog (do people even still have / read these?). In the past I toyed with the idea of creating one, but I never felt
I had anything important to say.  The fact is:  I still don't, but for the first time I feel that's okay.

I recently realized that much that I do professionally goes unnoticed and unappreciated, and that point of view is
subsequently adopted by me.  As a result, over time I forget the epiphanies, struggles, and triumphs of my mundane work
life and never fully appreciate the small things and the lessons and experiences I should take from them. Through this
blog, I plan to document the trivial things that keep me up at night and the brief moments of exuberance I experience
when learning something new or accomplishing something. For me, these lessons, realizations, and feelings are often
fleeting, and I hope documenting them will find new appreciation from my future self.
