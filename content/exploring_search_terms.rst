As the University of Tennessee Libraries is currently migrating our digital collections repository from Islandora 7 to
Hyku, we're also thinking about new access points for users to browse and find content in our collections. While we do
this, I thought it might be interesting to dive in and see: 1. what search terms users use in our repository currently,
2. if search terms are used, which collections are they used within and are they used in combination with other
demlimiting facets, and 3. which facets are used most often in lieu of search terms.
