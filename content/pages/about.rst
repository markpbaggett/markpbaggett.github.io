About
#####

This blog serves as an outlet for me to write about projects and other things I work on that are under appreciated or
have little to no value to others.  While I hope others read, the primary audience is my current and future self. I hope
to find through this outlet a new appreciation for the things I do and hope it inspires me to do more inventive things.
