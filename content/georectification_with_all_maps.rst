Since graduate school in the late 2000s, I've been interested in georectification of historic maps and developing
applications where users can experience them on the web. In my role of building and delivering Digital Collections at
the University of Tennessee, I've had fleeting thoughts over the years in possibly georectifying our map content and
allowing our users to experience those in an online mapping service. Recently, I've been experimenting with
`Bert Spaan's <https://github.com/bertspaan>`_ awesome `AllMaps <https://allmaps.org/>`_.  This article details my
experiments and potential ways of levering AllMaps or similar technology with repository content in the future.
